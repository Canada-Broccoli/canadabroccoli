Who is Jing-An Chen? 

Jing-An is a Taiwanese designer who currently live in Ottawa, Canada. 

As a designer, Jing-An is not satisfied with merely drawing some beautiful sketches on paper, he loves creating something real, touchable, interactable. 

This idea drives him to grasp the Beachler's degree of Industrial Design and even become a professional Full-Stack Designer.  

In Taiwan, designers are not only designers. The working market in Taiwan always wants designers to be all-knowing. To satisfy his employer, Jing-An pushed himself to learn as much as possible. Finally, Jing-An becomes a light-speed learner, he can grasp any specialty in one week, and his skills has across so many different fields including: 

Technical Drawing 

Ergonomics 

UI & UX 

Data Analytics 

Marketing 

Video Editing 

Photography 

Animating 

3D Modeling 

Project Management 

Psychology 

Patent Analytics 

Tele Sales 

Email Sales 

Search Engine Optimizing 

Woodworking 

Metalworking 

Electrical Engineering 

Bodybuilding 

Weightlifting 

To name but a few. 

 

Meanwhile, Jing-An is a movie and comedy lover. 

Inspired by Richard Sapper, a German industrial designer. 

Jing-An believes a good design is just like a good joke. 

It must be fun, joyful, able to twist audiences’ assumption,  

and triggering the audiences to enjoy the funny part once and once. 

This idea grows and becomes Jing-An's motto: 

“When it comes to design, humour matters” 

A designer who designs like a comedian; 

A photographer who shoots like a director; 

An engineer who works like an artist. 

 

Everything is different, everything is connected, like plants, like broccoli. 

This is Broccoli Design. 

This is Jing-An Chen.
