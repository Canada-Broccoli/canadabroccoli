                “Do I have to be creative to be a designer?” 

“Does designer just draw something on the paper randomly?” 

Well, yes, but actually no. 

The reason why we don’t have a clear idea of designer is because the term “Design” is used by so many various specialties. 

As a civil engineer, you “design” the construction of a building by mathematics. 

As a hairdresser, you “design” the hair style by your knowledge of fashion. 

As an artist, you “design” the artworks by your Aesthetics. 

These people are all “designing” something, but none of them are the typical “designer” in our stereotype. 

What does a designer do? What is designer? 

Let me tell you. 

 

Nowadays, there are 2 types of designers: 

Famous designers design more like an artist. 

Normal designers design more like a user behavior analyst. 

For famous designers, design is a method to express the issues they care about. Those issues can be war, climate change, air pollution, etc. That’s the reason why they work more like an artist. 

On the other hand, normal designers don’t get to work for themselves. Their job is to optimize the existing product, and they will use many different tools from many different fields such as psychology, or engineering and especially marketing.  

Fun fact is, the job most close to designer is not artist, it is marketer. 

As a professional designer, Jing-An is about to share some tools he uses in his daily work.

“Do I have to be creative to be a designer?” 

The truth is no one is creative. According to research, humanity doesn’t have the ability to “create” something out of nothing. Everything we can create is just a recombination of our pervious experiences. 

As for the illusion that “I am not creative” is just because too many possibilities overload our brains. What designers actually do is use tools and analysis to narrow down the infinity choices into several possible selections, then use these conditions to “design” a better product to sell. 

 

Do you need a designer?
